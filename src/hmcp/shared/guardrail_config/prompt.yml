prompts:
  - task: self_check_input
    content: |
      This is a placeholder prompt. The self_check_input implementation in actions.py is used instead of LLM-based policy checking.
      
      User Message:
      {user_input}
      
      Note: This prompt is not actually used for policy checking as we rely on programmatic rules in actions.py.
