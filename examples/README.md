## HMCP Demo Workflow

### Overview
The demo involves three agents working together:
1. AI Agent (Main Orchestrator)
2. EMR Writeback Agent
3. Patient Data Access Agent

### Detailed Workflow Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - AI Agent initializes authentication components
   - Generates JWT token for secure communication
   - Sets up OAuth client with test credentials

2. **EMR Writeback Agent Connection**
   - AI Agent connects to EMR Writeback Agent
   - Establishes SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection
   - Initializes EMR session

3. **First Clinical Data Submission**
   - AI Agent sends initial clinical data to EMR Writeback Agent
   - Data includes diagnosis, blood pressure, and medication information
   - Format: {"diagnosis": "Hypertension", "blood_pressure": "140/90", "medication": "Lisinopril 10mg"}

4. **Guardrail Testing**
   - AI Agent tests the guardrail functionality
   - Sends a test message to verify security measures
   - Verifies proper response handling

5. **Patient Data Access**
   - EMR Writeback Agent requests additional information (patient ID)
   - AI Agent connects to Patient Data Access Agent
   - Requests patient identifier for "John Smith"
   - Receives patient ID (PT12345)

6. **Final EMR Update**
   - AI Agent sends complete data to EMR Writeback Agent
   - Includes both clinical data and patient ID
   - Receives confirmation of successful EMR update

7. **Workflow Completion**
   - All required information is processed
   - EMR system is updated successfully
   - Demo workflow is completed

Note: The demo includes error handling and logging at each step to ensure proper execution and debugging capabilities.

## HMCP LLM Demo (GPT-4o Integration)

The `hmcp_llm_demo.py` file demonstrates an advanced version of the HMCP workflow that integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o to create intelligent agents that can generate dynamic, context-aware responses.

### Overview
Unlike the basic demo that uses predefined responses, the LLM demo employs three LLM-powered agents:

1. **AI Agent (Main Orchestrator)**: Uses GPT-4o to plan and coordinate the entire workflow
2. **EMR Writeback Agent**: Uses GPT-4o to intelligently respond to clinical data submission requests
3. **Patient Data Access Agent**: Uses GPT-4o to process and respond to patient identification requests

Each agent maintains its own conversation history and system prompt that defines its role and behavior.

### LLM Demo Features
- Context-aware responses from all agents
- Dynamic workflow planning by the AI Orchestrator
- Guardrail implementation to prevent prompt injection and unauthorized access
- Simulated patient database with intelligent lookups
- Conversation history maintenance for coherent multi-turn interactions

### How to Run the LLM Demo

```bash
# Ensure you have the required dependencies
cd examples
pip install -r requirements.txt

# create .env file with your OpenAI API key (REQUIRED for LLM integration)
# You must have access to GPT-4o or specify another model using LLM_MODEL environment variable
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

# Optional environment variables
HOST=0.0.0.0  # Default host
WRITEBACK_PORT=8050  # Default EMR Writeback Agent port
PATIENT_DATA_PORT=8060  # Default Patient Data Access Agent port 
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # Default log level
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o  # Default LLM model

# START EMR Writeback Agent server (LLM-powered)
# Open a new terminal and execute:
python hmcp_llm_demo.py --emr-server

# START Patient Data Access Agent server (LLM-powered)
# Open a new terminal and execute:
python hmcp_llm_demo.py --patient-data-server

# Run the LLM Demo using the AI Agent orchestrator
# Open a new terminal and execute:
python hmcp_llm_demo.py
```

### LLM Demo Workflow Steps

1. **AI Agent Planning**: The AI Agent uses GPT-4o to generate a comprehensive plan for the workflow.

2. **EMR Connection & Data Submission**: The AI Agent connects to the EMR Writeback Agent and submits clinical data about a hypertension patient.

3. **Intelligent Response**: The EMR Agent (using GPT-4o) determines that it needs a patient identifier and responds accordingly.

4. **Security Testing**: The AI Agent tests the guardrails by attempting to extract system prompts, verifying security constraints.

5. **Dynamic Decision Making**: The AI Agent analyzes the EMR response and determines it needs to get a patient identifier.

6. **Patient Data Retrieval**: The AI Agent connects to the Patient Data Access Agent and requests information for "John Smith".

7. **Context-Aware Extraction**: The AI Agent intelligently extracts the patient ID from the response.

8. **Complete Data Submission**: The AI Agent sends the complete clinical data with the patient ID to the EMR Writeback Agent.

9. **Workflow Summary**: The AI Agent generates a summary of the completed workflow using GPT-4o.
